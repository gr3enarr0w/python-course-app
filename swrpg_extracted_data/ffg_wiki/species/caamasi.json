    "Memnii: Caamasi often imprint significant events in their life as unfading memories called memnii. Once per game session, a Caamasi may form a new memnis that encompasses one scene or encounter. At any time, a Caamasi may perfectly recall any memnis that [they] have formed or witnessed, or share it with another Caamasi or a Force-sensitive character."
