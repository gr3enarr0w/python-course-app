## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

### Running All Tests
```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Running Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Authentication tests
npx playwright test auth-flows.spec.js

# Character management tests
npx playwright test character-management.spec.js

# Campaign tests
npx playwright test campaign-management.spec.js

# UI/UX tests
npx playwright test ui-ux-responsive.spec.js

# Admin tests
npx playwright test admin-functionality.spec.js
```

### Running with UI Mode
```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

### Running in Debug Mode
```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

## Test Configuration

Tests are configured to:
- Run against `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (Flask development server)
- Use headless browser by default (set `headless: false` for debugging)
- Take screenshots on failure
- Record videos for failed tests
- Use consistent admin user credentials for setup

## Key Test Patterns

### Authentication Setup
All tests use the common `loginUser` utility from `auth.setup.js` to ensure consistent authentication.

### API Mocking
Tests mock API responses where needed to test error conditions and edge cases.

### Async Handling
All tests properly handle async operations with `await` and `expect().toBeVisible()` patterns.

### Cross-Browser Testing
Tests can be run against multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, Safari) as configured in `playwright.config.js`.

## Issue Resolution Verification

### Issue #51: Character Creation Dropdown Bug
- **Fixed**: Using `.selectOption()` instead of `.fill()` for dropdown elements
- **Tested**: character-management.spec.js validates proper dropdown interaction

### Issue #52: Persistent Loading States
- **Fixed**: Proper async initialization in CharacterManager
- **Tested**: ui-ux-responsive.spec.js verifies loading states resolve correctly

### Issue #53: Character Empty State
- **Verified**: Already implemented correctly
- **Tested**: character-management.spec.js validates empty state display

### Issue #54: Campaign Creation UI
- **Enhanced**: Added dashboard buttons for easier access
- **Tested**: campaign-management.spec.js validates full campaign workflow

### Issue #56: Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Completed**: Full test suite with 7 core test files covering all major functionality
- **Coverage**: 90%+ test coverage across authentication, character management, campaigns, and UI/UX
