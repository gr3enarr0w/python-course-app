- ✅ Mobile Chrome

## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### Authentication & Security
1. **Unauthenticated Access** - Verify all protected endpoints block access
2. **Valid Authentication** - Confirm admin can access all features
3. **Invalid Tokens** - Ensure malformed/expired tokens are rejected
4. **Security Headers** - Validate proper security headers are present

### User Interface Testing
1. **Navigation Testing** - Click every navigation element
2. **Form Interaction** - Test all input fields and controls
3. **Button Testing** - Verify all buttons function correctly
4. **Role-Based Access** - Confirm UI elements show/hide by role

### Character Creation
1. **Species Selection** - Test all 55+ official species
2. **Career Selection** - Test all careers from three game lines
3. **Data Validation** - Verify form validation works
4. **API Integration** - Confirm character data saves correctly

## 📋 Test Results

Test results include:
- **Pass/Fail Status** for each test
- **Screenshots** at every major step
- **Performance Metrics** for API calls
- **Security Validation** results
- **Browser Compatibility** matrix

## 🚨 Known Test Scenarios

### Expected Behaviors
- **Regular User/Gamemaster Accounts**: May not exist (tests handle gracefully)
- **Some API Endpoints**: May return 404 (expected for unimplemented features)
- **Rate Limiting**: May not be implemented (noted in results)

### Test Assertions
- All protected API endpoints must return 401/403 for unauthenticated requests
- Admin interface must be fully functional
- Character creation must support all official species
- UI must be responsive and accessible

## 🔍 Debugging Tests

### View Screenshots
Screenshots are automatically captured and available in test artifacts:
- Dashboard views for each role
- Character creation steps
- Navigation testing
- Error scenarios

### Check Logs
Application logs are collected automatically:
- Flask application logs
- Authentication events
- API call logs
- Error traces

### Manual Debugging
For local debugging:
```bash
# Run with headed browser
npx playwright test --headed

# Run specific test with debug
npx playwright test tests/ui-admin-comprehensive.spec.js --debug

# Generate and view report
npx playwright show-report
```

## 🎉 Expected Results
