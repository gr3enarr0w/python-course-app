# Demo Authentication System Archive

This directory contains the demo authentication system that was used for testing.

## Archived Files
- `app_demo.py` - Original demo Flask app with static tokens (was already removed)

## Security Note
The original demo system contained:
- Static tokens (`admin_token`, `demo_token_12345`) 
- No password hashing
- No token validation
- Debug endpoints (`/api/debug/*`)

**NEVER use these components in production.**

## Status
✅ Demo authentication system has been completely removed from the codebase
✅ Production authentication system (app_with_auth.py) is active
✅ run_web.py correctly imports production auth system
✅ Debug mode is disabled in production
