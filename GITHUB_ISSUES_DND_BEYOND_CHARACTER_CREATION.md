# GitHub Issues for D&D Beyond-Style Character Creation Implementation

## Issues Created Today (June 13, 2025)

### Issue 1: Implement D&D Beyond-Style Character Creation Wizard
**Title:** [FEATURE] Implement D&D Beyond-Style Multi-Step Character Creation Wizard
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `frontend`, `character-creation`, `high-priority`
**Assignee:** @ceverson

**Description:**
Replace the current simple character creation form with a comprehensive, multi-step wizard similar to D&D Beyond's character builder.

**Current Problem:**
- Users can only set basic character info (name, species, career)
- No way to customize characteristics during creation 
- No skill customization options
- Characters are created with default stats (all characteristics at 2)
- No visual feedback or preview during creation
- Poor user experience compared to modern character builders

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement a 7-step character creation wizard:

1. **Character Basics** - Name, Player Name
2. **Species Selection** - Visual cards with stat previews
3. **Career Selection** - Grouped by game line with career skills
4. **Characteristic Assignment** - Interactive point-buy with XP tracking
5. **Skill Customization** - Career skill discounts, XP management
6. **Background & Details** - Backstory, obligations, notes
7. **Review & Create** - Final character preview and confirmation

**Technical Requirements:**
- Progressive disclosure UI with step navigation
- Real-time XP calculation and validation
- Live character preview in sidebar
- Mobile-responsive design
- Integration with existing character system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Multi-step wizard interface implemented
- [ ] Species selection with visual cards and stat preview
- [ ] Career selection with game line filtering
- [ ] Interactive characteristic assignment with XP costs
- [ ] Skill customization with career skill highlighting
- [ ] Character preview updates in real-time
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Characters created with proper stats (no more defaults)
- [ ] XP calculation prevents overspending
- [ ] Integration with existing character save system

**Files Modified:**
- `web/templates/create_character_wizard.html` (new)
- `web/app.py` (enhanced API endpoints)
- `web/templates/index_with_auth.html` (navigation updates)

### Issue 2: Enhance Character Creation API for Advanced Features
**Title:** [BACKEND] Enhance Character Creation API to Support Advanced Character Building
**Labels:** `backend`, `api`, `character-creation`, `enhancement`

**Description:**
Extend the character creation API to support the advanced character creation wizard features.

**Current Limitations:**
- API only accepts basic character info

2. **Advanced `/api/characters` POST endpoint**
   - Accept custom characteristic values
   - Support skill rank assignments
   - Calculate XP expenditure automatically
   - Validate XP spending limits

3. **XP Calculation Integration**
   - Real-time cost calculation for characteristics
   - Career vs non-career skill cost differences
   - Remaining XP tracking

**Technical Implementation:**
- Extend `CharacterCreator` class methods
- Enhance species and career data structures
- Add XP validation logic
- Improve error handling and validation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `/api/game-data` returns detailed species/career info

### Issue 3: Fix Flask Routing Errors for Missing Template Routes
**Title:** [BUGFIX] Add Missing Flask Routes for Template Navigation
**Labels:** `bug`, `backend`, `routing`, `templates`
**Assignee:** @ceverson

**Description:**
Fix `werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError` caused by missing Flask routes referenced in templates.

**Error Details:**
```
werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'campaigns_page'. Did you mean 'create_character_page' instead?
```

**Missing Routes:**
- `campaigns_page` â†’ `/campaigns`
- `admin_page` â†’ `/admin`  
- `profile_page` â†’ `/profile`
- `documentation_page` â†’ `/documentation`

**Root Cause:**
Templates reference `url_for()` endpoints that don't exist in the Flask app routing.

**Solution:**
Add missing route handlers to `web/app.py` for all template references.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All template `url_for()` references have corresponding routes
- [ ] No more routing build errors
- [ ] Navigation links work properly
- [ ] Character creation wizard loads without errors

**Files Modified:**
- `web/app.py` (add missing routes)

**Changes Required:**
1. **Main Dashboard**
   - "Create Character" button in characters list header
   - "Create Your First Character" button in empty state

2. **Navigation Updates**
   - Update all `onclick="showCreateCharacterForm()"` to `href="/create-character"`
