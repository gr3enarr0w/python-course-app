1. UPDATE CHARACTER_CREATOR.PY:
   - Expand the _initialize_species() method with the additional species from JavaScript data
   - Add the new career data from the JavaScript files
   - Ensure all special abilities are properly handled

2. API ENDPOINT UPDATES:
   - Modify /api/game-data endpoint to return the expanded species and career lists
   - Add species special abilities to the character data returned by /api/characters/<name>
   - Include specialization data in career information

3. FRONTEND INTEGRATION:
   - Use the JavaScript modules in the character creation UI
   - Implement species special ability display
   - Add career specialization selection
   - Use the validation functions before submitting to backend

4. DATA SYNCHRONIZATION:
   - Consider creating a data sync script that updates Python data from JavaScript files
   - Or use a shared JSON data format that both systems can read
   - Implement validation to ensure both systems stay in sync
