## Questionable Species Removed

The following 14 species were identified as questionable and removed from the database:

### Likely Fan-Created or Non-Canonical
- **Aqualish** - Not found in official species list
- **Bardottan** - Not found in official species list (Note: Bardottan is in F&D: Nexus of Power but may be misspelled)
- **Besalisk** - Not found in official species list
- **Clone** - Not found in official species list (Note: Clones are in Era books but may be variants)
- **Cotal** - Not found in official species list
- **Dathomirian** - Not found in official species list (Note: May be in Era books)
- **Duros** - Naming inconsistency with "Duro" - needs resolution
- **Ewok** - Not found in official species list
- **Gamorrean** - Not found in official species list
- **Harch** - Not found in official species list (Note: May be in Era books)
- **Jawa** - Not found in official species list
- **Karkarodon** - Not found in official species list (Note: May be in Era books)
- **Miraluka** - Not found in official species list
- **Talz** - Not found in official species list

### Removal Justifications
Most removed species were not found in the official species list extracted from 39 sourcebooks. However, some of these (like Ewok, Jawa, Clone, Dathomirian) are clearly canonical Star Wars species and may need further investigation to determine if they appear in sourcebooks not covered by our extraction.

## Missing Species

The following 25 species are in the official species list but lack complete game statistics:

- Anx, Aquahsh, Besahsk, Chadra-Fan, Clawdite, Corelhan Human, Dresselhan, Dug, Duro, Elom, Elomin, Gossam, Gotal, Ishi Tib, Kalleran, Kyuzo, Lannik, Mandalorian Human, Mustafarian, Pohs Massan, Quermian, Shistavanen, Verpine, Whipid, Xexto

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Resolve Duro/Duros naming inconsistency** - This is a core AoR species that should be verified
2. **Investigate Era book species** - Clone, Dathomirian, Harch, Karkarodon may be legitimate
3. **Verify clearly canonical species** - Ewok, Jawa should be investigated further

### Database Updates
1. **Update character creation tool** to use only the 42 verified species
2. **Implement missing species** with complete statistics from sourcebooks
3. **Add source citations** to all species entries for verification

### Quality Assurance
1. **Regular verification cycles** against new sourcebook releases
2. **Community review** of questionable species before removal
3. **Maintain audit trail** of all species additions/removals

## Technical Implementation

The verified species database is stored in:
- **Primary:** `/swrpg_extracted_data/FINAL_VERIFIED_SPECIES_DATABASE.json`
- **Analysis:** `/final_species_analysis.json`
- **Backup:** `/swrpg_extracted_data/verified_species_database.json`

### Database Structure
